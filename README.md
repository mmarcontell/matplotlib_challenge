Analysis

First, the drugs Capomulin and Ramicane have the lowest mean and median tumor volume out of all drugs tested, with the lowest standard deviation as well. It  would be probable to infer that Capomulin and Ramicane have the best results of the drugs tested in terms of tumor volume.
    
Next, while Infubinol and Ceftamin have similar results on the summary table, Infubinol has an outlier as descibed in the boxplot. The data for Infubinol may need to be adjusted to account for this, or the result could require more investigation.
    
Finally, there is a strong correlation between the weight of a mouse and the volume of a tumor for the Capomulin regimen. With a correlation of 0.84, generally, as the mouse weight increases, so does the volume of the tumor.
